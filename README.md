My first HTML/CSS school project. 

The objective was to develop a website for a fictional or real organization/client, creating a unique project idea from scratch.

The website design was based on a specific color palette and emphasized accessibility, meeting AA-level requirements for sufficient contrast between text and background colors.

Ensuring responsiveness across various devices, the site was designed to function seamlessly on screens ranging from 360px (mobiles) to 980px (desktops).

The project consisted of two HTML pages, interconnected to form a cohesive web experience. This encompassed crafting a homepage and a secondary page, each contributing to the overall narrative of the website
